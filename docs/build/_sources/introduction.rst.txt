Introduction 
============
:mod:`GenoKit` is a python package for genome feature extraction in bioinformatics.
The package contains two useful executable command programs. The first executable program 
is GenoKit including ten subroutines termed create, gene, promoter, UTR, uORF,CDS, 
dORF, exon, intron, intergenic. The create subroutine is used for creating database. The 
promoter subroutine is used for extracting promoter sequence. The uORF subroutine is used for 
extracting upstream open reading frames sequence. The UTR subroutine is used for extracting 
untranslated region sequence. The CDS subroutine is used for extracting coding sequence. The 
intergenic subroutine is used for extracting intergenic sequence between two genes. The second 
executable program is genBankExtract including four subroutines termed gene, CDS, rRNA, tRNA.
